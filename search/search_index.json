Header Slides Images Videos Putting Content Into Columns Linking Slides Override Presentation Defaults Override Slide Defaults Fit Text To Slide Width Change Word or Phrase Color Change Word or Phrase Size Using Mermaid Diagrams With Marp Using Plotly Graphs With Marp Useful Websites what-is-marp | Marp (also known as the Markdown Presentation Ecosystem) provides an intuitive experience for creating beautiful slide decks. You only have to focus on writing your story in a Markdown document. I use Marp instead of Powerpoint to create presenations I use in lectures, talks, and tutorials. If you're a coder or otherwise comfortable with creating documents with plaintext (especially Markdown), then this might be for you. However, for most people, using PowerPoint or some other presenetaiton software package will be faaar easier! An easy way to get started is to use Marp via VSCode or VSCodium , but I use Marp CLI with PyCharm . Quick Overview Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzQ-p41wNEE More about Marp Here: https://marp.app/ Quick video installing-marp Basic Setup If you want to use Marp with VSCode or VSCodium , you can find it in the normal VSCode marketplace, e.g.: Marp for VS Code If you want to use Marp with another editor or IDE (I use PyCharm becasue I already use it frequently for Python development, otherwise I'd probably use VSCodium . This means that I use use Marp-CLI (i.e., the commandline interface). You can learn more more here: Marp-CLI By far the easiest way to install Marp is to use one of the standalone binaries from the marp-cli [Releases Page]. I recommend putting the resulting Marp executable somewhere in your system Path. NOTE that if you instead use pip or npx to install Marp, it may already be on your path. Use the Marp-CLI instructions for info on how to get to the point where you can run Marp from anywhere on your system. Setup Chrome Browser for Rendering The Marp-CLI page discusses how to make sure you have chrome setup for rendering. On Ubuntu Linux (actually, I use Pop!_OS , an OS by system76 based on Ubuntu), I used these instructions: sudo add-apt-repository ppa:savoury1/chromium sudo apt update sudo apt install chromium-browser export CHROME_PATH=/usr/bin/chromium-browser marp-cli-workflow Setup For each new slideshow: create a new folder to hold the slideshow create 2 subfloders, \"images\" and \"media\" create a markdown file called \"slides.md\" create a batch file called dev.sh (mac or linux, dev.bat on windows??) and make it executable. create a batch file called make_pdf.sh (mak or linux, make_pdf.sh on windows??) and make it executable.

It will also render the current slideshow in a little window so you can see what you are doing (that's what the -p flag does). Here is my workflow: run ./dev.sh Make a change to slides.md Whenever I want to see what I've done in the preview window, I save the file (or enable auto-save for continous updates) If I want to see a full-size version in a webbrowser, I drag slides.html to my webbrowser (I use Firefox ), but I have to refresh to see any subsequent changes (which is why I prefer to use the preview window). To include images, I save them to the images folder and then refer to them as something like ./images/imagename.png To include videos, I save them to the media folder then refer to them as something like ./media/videoname.mp4 When donw editing, I cancel out of the process running ./dev.sh (e.g., using CTRL-C). To create a PDF, I run ./make_pdf.sh That's it. Making changes to my slides is as easy as editing the text in slides.md . Using My Presentations Marp renders your markdown presentation code into a working static HTML presentation. Thus, to show your presentation, just drag slides.html into your browser! I do the following: Drag slides.html into Firefox Click the Presenter's View Icon on the right side of the slide navigation bar at the bottom, which creates another webpage showing the presenter's view. I keep the presenter's view page on the primary monitor where I can see it and I drag the normal presentation window onto the external monitor so the audiene can see it. moving around in presenter's view automatically controls the audience view. Note: To show videos, you have to press start/stop/etc. on the normal presentation window. When done, just close the slideshow browser tabs and you're done. what-is-marp-to-pdf In the My Marp Workflow section, the make_pdf.sh contents has a command called marp2pdf that is commented out. What is this? Marp2PDF is a tool I wrote which does the following: looks for the file slides.md and makes a temporary copy of it edits the copy to remove any image markup that is followed with this text: <!-- nopdf --> in the watermark subsection of the style frontmatter, replaces the text section::after with section::before uses Marp-cli to re-render this temp file to slides_public.pdf uses ghostscript to do a medium-level image compressed version of the content in slides_public.pdf and saves it using the same name. The result is a considerably smaller PDF that has my watermark image repated across it and that omits images I think would be inappropriate for a public copy (e.g., copyrighted images, etc.). All of this occurs without altering either the original slides.md or the standard slides.pdf generated by Marp. Marp2PDF assumes the following: chromium-browser is installed (e.g., mine is installed at /usr/bin/chromium-browser ) ghostscript is installed (e.g., mine is installed at /usr/bin/gs ) marp-cli is installed (e.g., mine is installed at /home/[USERNAME]/Applications/marp ) Why is marp2pdf commented out in make_pdf.sh ? That's because it's not yet available publically. When it is, I'll adjust the relevant FAQs. For now, you can just use the default PDF Marp produces, or make the changes I indicated above yourself and then regenerate the PDF. header-slides I like headers largeish text over a full-slide images: ![bg](images/fullslide_background_image.png) <!-- nopdf --> # <span style=\"color:orange\"><!--fit-->My Main Title</span> ## <center>My Subtitle If Needed</center> ### <center>For Lectures, I include Course, Quarter and Year</center> images Plain markdown image spec: ![](./images/myimage.jpg) With width specified in pixels (height will be auto-computed) ![w:800px](./images/myimage.jpg) Centered Note: spaces between div tags and markdown is crucial! <div class=\"centerit\"> ![w:800px](./images/myimage.jpg) </div> Absolute positioning This allows you to place an image anywhere on the slide!
